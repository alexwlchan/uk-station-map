# uk-station-map

This is a quick script I wrote to create a map showing which UK railway stations I've visited:

![A map of the UK with a series of green dots overlaid.](https://github.com/alexwlchan/uk-station-map/raw/development/station_map.png)

It uses:

-    ✨ [**OpenStreetMap**](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) ✨ for the map tiles<br/>
-    ✨ [**Leaflet.js**](https://leafletjs.com/) ✨ to render the map and the markers for each station<br/>
-    ✨ [**Trainline**](https://www.transportapi.com/), [**Trainline EU**](https://github.com/trainline-eu/stations) and [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_railway_stations_in_Ireland) ✨ to get the longitude/latitude coordinates of railway stations

A couple of people asked, so I'm sharing the code here for them to play with -- but reader beware, this was a quick experiment, so it's fairly unpolished code.



## Usage

Go to <https://uk-stations-map.glitch.me/>, and type in the names of stations you've visited.
See them appear on the map before your eyes!



## Support

None.

This is a one-off experiment I wrote for fun, not something I want to spend lots of time on.
Requests for support or help to run this code will be ignored.
